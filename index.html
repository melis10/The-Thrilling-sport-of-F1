  <h2>What is Formula 1?</h2>
  <p>
    Formula 1 is the fastest, loudest, most intense kind of car racing on the planet. Drivers race ultra-light,
    open-wheel cars that can corner harder than a roller coaster and blast past 300 km/h, fighting 19 other
    drivers at the same time. 
    Across the year, they compete in a world championship made up of race weekends in different countries,
    scoring points at each race for themselves and their teams. Two big trophies are on the line: the Drivers’
    Championship for the best driver and the Constructors’ Championship for the best team.

 <h2>What Makes F1 So Fun?</h2>

<div class="text-with-image">
  <div class="fun-text">
    <p>
      Formula 1 isn't just cars going fast, it's a full-on entertainment experience powered by larger-than-life driver personalities and some of the best social media content in sports.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drivers win fans over by leaning into the fun, human side of the sport, especially on social media. They jump on TikTok trends, from POV memes to goofy lip-sync audios, showing they don't take themselves too seriously. 
      Behind-the-scenes content is huge too: everything from pre-race rituals and simulator sessions to chaotic travel vlogs lets fans feel like they're getting exclusive access to the real driver, not just the helmeted version on track.
    </p>
    <p>
      Teams also boost driver personalities with games and contests—trivia battles, reaction challenges, blindfolded drawing, "who knows who better," and random competitiveness that always turns hilarious. 
      And of course, the bromances are fan favorites; whether it's playful teasing, heartfelt moments, or chaotic energy between teammates or rivals-turned-friends, these relationships make drivers feel more relatable and lovable.
      Altogether, this blend of trends, authenticity, humor, and connection keeps fans hooked and makes drivers feel like real people you can root for.

      <h2>How an F1 Weekend Works</h2>
      <p>
        A normal race weekend has three main pieces: practice, qualifying, and the race.
      </p>
      
      <ol class="weekend-schedule">
        <li>
          <strong>Practice Sessions</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Test car set-ups and configurations</li>
            <li>Try different tyre compounds</li>
            <li>Learn the track layout and find optimal racing lines</li>
            <li>Build speed progressively</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Qualifying</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Three knockout sessions (Q1, Q2, Q3)</li>
            <li>Fastest lap earns pole position</li>
            <li>Determines starting grid for the race</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The Grand Prix</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Main race event with full distance</li>
            <li>Strategic pit stops for fresh tyres</li>
            <li>Points awarded to top 10 finishers</li>
            <li>Podium ceremony for top 3</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>

   
    <div>
      <h2>Laps, Distance, and Race Length</h2>
      <p>
        F1 races aren't all the same lap count; instead, each Grand Prix targets about 305 km of total distance,
        with Monaco as a famous shorter exception.
        That means shorter tracks use more laps and long tracks use fewer laps, but most races still last around
        1.5–2 hours of intense racing. Drivers also get to take on some of the coolest, most unique circuts in the world.
        Blasting down the Las Vegas Strip, weabing past neon hotels and casinos, racing through iconic cities like Singapore,
        or tackling purpose-built tracks with elevation changes like Suzuka and Austin. Each track brings its own vibe, challenge, and scenery
        making F1 a world tour of speed.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Bahrain Grand Prix: 57 laps of night racing in the desert.</li>
        <li>Monaco Grand Prix: around 78 laps through super-tight city streets and barriers.</li>
        <li>Belgian Grand Prix (Spa): roughly 44 laps of one of the longest, most flowing circuits on the calendar.</li>
      </ul>

  <h2>Where in the World F1 Races</h2>
  <p>
    The 2025 championship runs over 24 race weekends, making it one of the longest and busiest seasons F1 has
    ever seen. 
  
    The calendar jumps across the globe: early races in the Middle East, classics like Australia, Emilia Romagna,
    Monaco, Canada, and Silverstone, plus legendary speed tracks at Monza and Suzuka. 
 
    There are also modern street and night races in cities such as Jeddah, Singapore, and Las Vegas, along with
    multiple stops in the United States like Miami and Austin. Each circuit has its own character—some focus on
    long straights and top speed, others are twisty and technical, and a few are known for wild weather and huge
    crowds.

<section>
  <h2>The 2025 F1 Grid</h2>
  <p>
    There are 10 teams and 20 race drivers in 2025. Each team, called a constructor, runs two cars and two
    drivers who share data and a garage but still race each other for points and titles. 
  </p>

  <div class="grid-layout">
    <ul class="drivers">
      <li>Red Bull Racing – Max Verstappen and Yuki Tsunoda.</li>
      <li>Mercedes – Kimi Antonelli and George Russell.</li>
      <li>Ferrari – Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc.</li>
      <li>McLaren – Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri.</li>
      <li>Aston Martin – Fernando Alonso and Lance Stroll.</li>
      <li>Alpine – Pierre Gasly and Franco Colapinto.</li>
      <li>Williams – Alex Albon and Carlos Sainz.</li>
      <li>Haas – Esteban Ocon and Oliver Bearman.</li>
      <li>Sauber – Nico Hülkenberg and Gabriel Bortoleto.</li>
      <li>Racing Bulls – Isack Hadjar and Liam Lawson.</li>

  <h2>Who Just Won the World Championship?</h2>
  
  <div class="content-with-image">
    <img src="Lando.jpg" alt="Lando Norris Formula 1 Champion" class="champion-image">
    <div class="champion-text">
      <p>
        The season has just wrapped up, and the newest World Drivers' Champion is Lando Norris. After years of being a
        fan favorite and regular podium finisher, he finally delivered a complete season and claimed his first F1
        title.
      </p>
      <p>
        Driving for McLaren, Norris turned the papaya-orange car into a championship-winning machine, combining clutch
        wins, strong points on tough days, and enough consistency to beat some of the biggest names in modern F1.
        Now that he is the reigning champ, every new season starts with the same question for the grid: can anyone
        catch Lando?
